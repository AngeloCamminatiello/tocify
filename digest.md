<p>by Khady Diagne, Thomas M. Bury, Morgan E. Pettebone, Marc W. Deyell, Zachary Laksman, Alvin Shrier, Leon Glass, Gil Bub, Emilia Entcheva</p> Phase resetting of cardiac oscillators underlies some complex arrhythmias. Here we use optogenetic stimulation to construct phase response curves (PRC) for spheroids of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and a computational cardiomyocyte model to identify ionic mechanisms shaping the PRC. The clinical utility of the hu…

<p>by Gaurav Sharma, Bernard Marius ’t Hart, Jean-Jacques Orban de Xivry, Denise Y.P. Henriques, Mireille E. Broucke</p> A fundamental problem of visuomotor adaptation research is to understand how the brain is capable to asymptotically remove a predictable exogenous disturbance from a visual error signal using limited sensor information by re-calibration of hand movement. From a control theory perspective, the most striking aspect of this problem is that it falls squarely in the realm of the in…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>by Anna Shafer-Skelton, Timothy F. Brady, John T. Serences</p> Understanding 3D representations of spatial information, particularly in naturalistic scenes, remains a significant challenge in vision science. This is largely because of conceptual difficulties in disentangling higher-level 3D information from co-occurring features and cues (e.g., the 3D shape of a scene image is necessarily defined by “low-level” spatial frequency and orientation information). Recent work has employed newer mod…
