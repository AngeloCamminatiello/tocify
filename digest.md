Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 7, February 2026. <br />SignificanceMunc13-1 primes synaptic vesicles for rapid release at the presynaptic membrane. Reconstitution on supported bilayers and Cryo-EM reveal that Munc13-1 cycles between upright (trimeric) and lateral (hexameric) conformations. Munc13 binds PI(4,5)...
