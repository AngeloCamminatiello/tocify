# Weekly ToC Digest (week of 2026-02-10)

No items highly relevant to your primary interests in neural dynamics and data science methods were found. The items this week did not directly match user interests. No papers on neural/physiological modeling or oscillations were present. Check future issues for relevant topics. This week's items were largely outside the scope of specified interests, with no relevant neural dynamics or time series analysis. As such, none scored significantly high for prioritization.

**Included:** 1 (score ≥ 0.35)

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 6, February 2026. <br />SignificanceMultiple modulatory systems like the serotonergic and spinal V0c interneurons studied here interact during locomotion. We demonstrate how the nervous system matches motor output to the motor demand of behaviors, and that motor demand is a ...
